# Tasktracker3

Design Choices:-
1. The user will be first directed to the index screen where they are given an option to either register as a new user or log in as en existing one.

2. When the user logs in, if the name and password match, they can view their tasks and assign new tasks to existing users.

3. To assign tasks to different users, they choose from different users, enter title, description, whether task is completed or not and the time of the task.

4. Each user can view their tasks and edit them.

5. When a user chooses to edit their task, they are shown the edit form where they can alter the details of the task and submit.

6. Also, there is a list of all users currently registered shown.
